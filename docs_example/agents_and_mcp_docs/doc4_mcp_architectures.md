# MCP (Model Context Protocol) Architectures

## Introduction to MCP

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) represents a standardized approach for enabling AI models and agents to access external tools, resources, and services in a secure and controlled manner. MCP architectures provide the foundation for building extensible AI systems that can interact with diverse external capabilities.

## Core MCP Components

**MCP Servers**: These are the providers of tools and resources that AI agents can utilize. Servers expose specific capabilities through standardized interfaces, allowing agents to perform actions beyond their base training.

**MCP Clients**: AI agents or applications that consume services from MCP servers. Clients initiate connections and make requests for tools and resources.

**Protocol Layer**: The standardized communication protocol that defines how clients and servers interact, including message formats, authentication, and error handling.

## Architectural Patterns

**Hub-and-Spoke**: A centralized architecture where a single MCP hub manages connections to multiple servers and clients, providing routing and coordination services.

**Peer-to-Peer**: Distributed architecture where MCP-enabled agents can directly connect to relevant servers without central coordination.

**Hierarchical**: Multi-layered architecture with different levels of MCP servers, allowing for specialized services at different abstraction levels.

## Server Types

**Local Servers**: Run on the same machine as the client, providing access to local resources like file systems, databases, or system utilities.

**Remote Servers**: Hosted services that provide specialized capabilities like web APIs, cloud services, or external data sources.

**Proxy Servers**: Intermediate servers that aggregate or transform capabilities from multiple underlying services.

## Security and Access Control

MCP architectures implement robust security measures including authentication, authorization, capability-based access control, and sandboxing to ensure safe interaction between agents and external resources.

## Benefits of MCP Architectures

- **Extensibility**: Easy addition of new capabilities without modifying core agent logic
- **Standardization**: Consistent interfaces across different tool providers
- **Security**: Controlled access to external resources with proper isolation
- **Scalability**: Distributed architecture supports growing numbers of agents and services
