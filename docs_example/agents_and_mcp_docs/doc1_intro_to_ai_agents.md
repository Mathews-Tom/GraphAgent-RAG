# Introduction to AI Agents

## What are AI Agents?

AI agents are autonomous software entities designed to perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. Unlike traditional software programs that follow predetermined instructions, AI agents exhibit intelligent behavior by adapting to changing conditions and learning from their experiences.

## Key Characteristics

**Autonomy**: AI agents operate independently without constant human intervention, making decisions based on their programming and learned experiences.

**Reactivity**: They respond to changes in their environment in real-time, adjusting their behavior accordingly.

**Proactivity**: Beyond just reacting, AI agents can take initiative to achieve their goals, planning and executing complex sequences of actions.

**Social Ability**: Many AI agents can interact and communicate with other agents, humans, or systems to accomplish collaborative tasks.

## Types of AI Agents

- **Simple Reflex Agents**: React to current perceptions without considering history
- **Model-Based Agents**: Maintain internal state and model of the world
- **Goal-Based Agents**: Act to achieve specific objectives
- **Utility-Based Agents**: Optimize for maximum utility or satisfaction
- **Learning Agents**: Improve performance through experience and feedback

## Applications

AI agents are increasingly deployed across various domains including customer service, autonomous vehicles, trading systems, smart home automation, and personal assistants. Their ability to operate independently while maintaining goal-oriented behavior makes them valuable for tasks requiring continuous monitoring and decision-making.
